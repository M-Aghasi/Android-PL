# Android-PL
Android PL is a collection of multiple Java/Android library modules which gives a useful handset of tools to Java/Android developers for speeding up their development.

## Modules
here is a complete list of all modules exist in Android-PL with short description

* ###  [Algorithms](algorithms/README.md)
    This module consists of some common algorithms for sorting, searching, word matching ... and data structures like trees
    for solving various problems gracefully!

    I tried to avoid redundancy, and only added algorithms and data structures which doesn't exist in Java and android standard libraries(i hope!).
    
* ### [Android MVVM](mvvm/README.md)
    This module was a initial draft for implementing mvvm in Android that I wrote a long time ago and unfortunately has been discontinued.
